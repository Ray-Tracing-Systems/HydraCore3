* **HHMC (2015)** does not does not take geometric discontinuities into account (this paper does).
* "We assume no point light sources and no perfectly specular surfaces" $-$ sounds like bruh.

**Their problem**: differentiate $\int_M f(x, y)dx$ with respect to $y$.  
We cannot do $\frac{\partial}{\partial y}\int_M f(x, y)dx = \int_M \frac{\partial}{\partial y} f(x, y)dx$,
because f(x, y) is not necessarily differentiable by $y$.

Example: $\int_M f(x, y)dx = \int_0^1 sgn(x - y)dx = \int_0^ydx = y$ is differentiable by y (but $sgn(\cdot)$ is not).

**Our (Langevin) problem**: given $\int_M f(x) dx$, differentiate $f(x)$.  
Discontinuity of $f(x)$ is a problem too, but not directly related.

Is this even applicable to Langevin?


### Testing how [EnzymeAD](https://enzyme.mit.edu/) deals with $\log(x \cdot y)$
Idea: it is faster to differentiate $\log(x) + \log(y)$ than $\log(x \cdot y)$.
Experiments show that Enzyme **does not** run any relevant optimizations.

Run `log_test.cpp` in `langevin_specific` folder to see the results.
Example command (use your own `ClangEnzyme` path):
```
clang++-17 log_test.cpp -fplugin=../../Enzyme_103/enzyme/build/Enzyme/ClangEnzyme-17.so -O3 && ./a.out
```

Output:
```
Differentiate `log(x_1 * ... * x_100)`
Elapsed time: 880ms
Gradient: ( ... )

Differentiate `log(x_1) + ... + log(x_100)`
Elapsed time: 70ms
Gradient: ( ... )
